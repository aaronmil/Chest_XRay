The objective of this project is to classify images of chest x-rays into three classes: Normal, COVID-19, and Pneumonia. Classification was performed using transfer learning by implementing the Inception V3 and ResNet 101 V2 architectures. A practical use of these models would be for medical clinicians to analyze chest x-rays to diagnose Pneumonia or COVID-19. Comparing the performance of the two models, the ResNet101 V2 model had the lowest validation loss and the highest f1 score, though the performance Inception V3 was only slightly worse than that of ResNet101 V2. The ResNet model had recall scores of 100% and 93.3% for the COVID19 and PNEUMONIA classes respectively, indicating a low likelihood of the model predicting a false-negative of either class.
